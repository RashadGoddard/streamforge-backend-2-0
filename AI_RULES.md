## AI Development Guidelines

1. **Model Training**: All AI models must be trained with real streaming data from multiple DSP platforms
2. **Federated Learning**: Evasion strategies must be updated via federated learning across proxy nodes
3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Required for all blockchain transactions to maintain deniability
4. **Human Behavior Simulation**: Must include realistic delays, interaction patterns, and randomized behavior
5. **Real-time Analysis**: Trend analysis must incorporate real-time DSP detection signals
6. **Cross-Platform Optimization**: AI must optimize across all 12 supported platforms simultaneously
7. **Self-Evolution**: Models must automatically evolve based on detection pattern changes
8. **Redundancy**: Multiple evasion strategies must be available for each platform
9. **Performance Monitoring**: AI must self-monitor success rates and adjust strategies accordingly
10. **Compliance**: All operations must maintain plausible deniability through blockchain auditing

## Platform-Specific Rules

### Spotify
• Use transformer-based play pattern simulation
• Implement randomized skip behavior (10-30 second skips)
• Rotate user agents and device fingerprints every 50 streams

### TikTok
• Emulate viral loop behavior (scroll, like, share patterns)
• Use video completion rates between 45-180 seconds
• Implement duet/share simulation for organic appearance

### YouTube
• Vary watch durations between 45-180 seconds
• Implement like/comment randomization
• Use multiple account rotation strategies

### Twitch
• Simulate live stream viewing patterns
• Implement chat interaction emulation
• Use clip viewing for shorter engagement

## Quality Assurance

1. **Success Rate**: Maintain minimum 99% evasion success rate
2. **Latency**: Keep boost operations under 2 seconds per stream
3. **Scalability**: Support millions of concurrent streams
4. **Uptime**: Maintain 99.9% system availability
5. **Security**: All data must be quantum-safe encrypted at rest and in transit

## Deployment Rules

1. **Multi-Cloud**: Deploy across AWS, GCP, and Azure simultaneously
2. **Auto-Scaling**: Implement automatic scaling based on demand
3. **Region Optimization**: Auto-select optimal regions based on latency and cost
4. **Zero-Downtime**: All updates must be rolling deployments
5. **Backup**: Daily blockchain and database backups with 30-day retention

## Monitoring & Alerting

1. **Real-time Metrics**: Monitor success rates, latency, and evasion confidence
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Alert on detection pattern changes
3. **Capacity Planning**: Predictive scaling based on trend analysis
4. **Security Alerts**: Immediate notification of any security incidents
5. **Revenue Tracking**: Real-time revenue estimation and optimization

## Ethical Guidelines
