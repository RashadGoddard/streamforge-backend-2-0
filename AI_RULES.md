# AI Rules & Tech Stack

## Tech Stack

• **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
• **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
• **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js for Node.js (backend), Core ML for iOS
• **Blockchain**: Hyperledger Fabric for immutable audit logs
• **Mobile**: iOS app built with SwiftUI and SwiftData
• **Authentication**: JWT with quantum-safe encryption (Kyber-512)
• **Proxy Management**: Multi-cloud proxy orchestration with BrightData
• **Web Automation**: Puppeteer for browser-based stream boosting
• **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics with Winston logging
• **Deployment**: Docker containers with Kubernetes orchestration

## AI Library Usage Rules

### Backend AI/ML
• **TensorFlow.js** (`@tensorflow/tfjs-node`): Use for all backend machine learning tasks including evasion prediction, trend analysis, and model training
• **Puppeteer**: Required for web-based stream boosting; use with WebRTC spoofing for advanced fingerprint evasion
• **Hyperledger Fabric SDK**: Mandatory for blockchain logging of all stream activities

### iOS AI/ML
• **Core ML**: Use for all on-device machine learning tasks including evasion strategy selection
• **Create ML**: Permitted for training new models that will be deployed to Core ML

### Proxy & Network Management
• **BrightData/Apify**: Use for proxy management and IP rotation
• **Axios**: Primary HTTP client for all API communications

### Security & Encryption
• **Kyber-JS**: Mandatory for all quantum-safe encryption needs
• **Crypto-JS**: Permitted for fallback encryption methods
• **BCryptJS**: Required for all password hashing

### Data Processing & Analysis
• **Cheerio**: Use for web scraping and HTML parsing
• **Node-cron**: Required for scheduled AI model updates

### Logging & Monitoring
• **Winston**: Required for all application logging
• **Prom-client**: Mandatory for Prometheus metrics collection

## AI Development Guidelines

1. All AI models must be trained with real streaming data
2. Evasion strategies must be updated via federated learning
3. Zero-knowledge proofs required for all blockchain transactions
4. Human behavior simulation must include realistic delays and interaction patterns
5. Trend analysis must incorporate real-time DSP detection signals
